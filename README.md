# July 19, 2017 Meetup

Thank you all for another great Meetup and a big thank you to Raizlabs for hosting.

In this Meetup, we briefly discussed some of the basics of Swift, using a Playground. After that we broke into groups.

Sean helped cover more of the basics. He touched upon topics like variables, constants, functions, and data structures (like `Dictionary`).

Zev was gracious enough to help people with more specific, individual questions.

Matt built upon a calculator app that was started in a previous Meetup (included in this repo). He and the people in his group built out the functionality for subtraction, multiplication, and clearing data. Along the way they also cleaned up so bugs left in the preexisting version of the app.

This was Learn Swift Boston's 12th Meetup. Which means we've been meeting for a whole year. We can't thank the developer community in Boston enough for all the support they shown us over the last year. It's been incredibly fun and inspiring. Thank you.
